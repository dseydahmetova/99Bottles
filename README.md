# 99Bottles
Build an express application that enables users to count down the number of bottles of beer. Don't like beer? Pass around bottles of soda, kombucha, or milk etc.

## Instructions
`mkdir pass-it-around`
`cd pass-it-around`
`npm init -y`
`build a basic express server`


### Requirements
On the home page (get "/"), users should see:

* "99 Bottles of beer on the wall"
* a link that says "take one down, pass it around"
* this should link to /98, where the number represents the number of bottles left.
* When a number is given in the url (get "/:number_of_bottles"), users should see:

The number of bottles of beer on the wall (i.e. 98 Bottles of beer on the wall.)
a link to "take one down, pass it around", where the href is number of bottles in the parameter minus 1.
If there are 0 bottles left, do not show a link to "take one down"

* Add a link to start over, which directs the user back to the home page.

- Hints
You should use an anchortag with an hrefto link to the next 'page'

## Bonus
Have some more fun
Update your page to be something like

`99 little bugs in the code`
`99 little bugs`
`Take on down`
`Patch it around`
`127 bugs in the code`

Make the bugs go down by one, but then have some sort of functionality where the bug count can randomlygo up

You have a lot of freedom to make it work how you want!
